This is a compendium of C++ routines useful for Bayesian statistics. We
steal other people’s C++ code, repurpose it, and export, so that
developers of R packages can use them easily in the C++ code of their R
packages. We actually don’t steal anything, but copy code that is
compatible with the our GPL 3 licence, fully acknowledging the
authorship of the original code.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **StealLikeBayes** like so:
