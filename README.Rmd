A **C++** Compendium of Bayesian Statistical Routines for **R** Packages

<!-- badges: start -->
[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/bsvars/StealLikeBayes/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bsvars/StealLikeBayes/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml)

This is a compendium of C++ routines useful for Bayesian statistics. We steal other people's C++ code, repurpose it, and export it so developers of R packages can use it in their C++ code. We actually don't steal anything, or claim that Thomas Bayes did, but copy code that is compatible with our GPL 3 licence, fully acknowledging the authorship of the original code.

## How to contribute

You are welcome to contribute to **StealLikeBayes**! How does this work?

### Things to remember

- We only accept code from packages and repositories with compatible licences. If you are contributing code from a package distributed under **GPL 3** you're good. Otherwise, you must argue the licence compatibility.
- Fully acknowledge the source of the contributed code in the file with your code and documentation.
- Once you contribute, we might reach out later for you to join the authors of a paper to be published on the basis of this package.
- Provide one Bayesian statistical routine per submission.
- Your submission must consist of:
  - one **C++** file, `src/*.cpp`
  - the corresponding **C++** header file, `src/*.h`
  - one **R** file with a wrapper for your main **C++** function, `R/*.R` with full documentation and acknowledgement of the original code authorship,
  - one **R** file with tests of your function, `inst/tinytest/test_*.R`,
  - updates on your authorship in `DESCRIPTION`,
  - if required, updates on dependencies in `DESCRIPTION` and `R/StealLikeBayes-package.R`.

### To-do list

- [ ] Open an issue by clicking *New issue* >> *A new submission template*.
- [ ] Fork the repository [bsvars/StealLikeBayes](https://github.com/bsvars/StealLikeBayes).
- [ ] Follow the [instructions from the issue](https://bsvars.org/StealLikeBayes/articles/Instrucions.html).
- [ ] Always push your commits linking them all to your issue by including the hash tag of your issue.
- [ ] Run checks of the package locally. They all need to pass!
```
Rcpp::compileAttributes()
devtools::document()

- [ ] Submit your Pull Request.
- [ ] Respond to all the comments from the maintainer.

## How to use the package **StealLikeBayes**

Please, feel free to use it whatever way you feel like, ofc! We create it with two intended uses:

### Use our **C++** code in your **R** package

In order to use our **C++** code in your **R** package you need to ensure you include all the dependencies to both: our package, and packages on which our functions rely on such as **RcppArmadillo**. The latter is on you!

To use **C++** code from **StealLikeBayes** follow the steps:

- [ ] Include dependencies in your `DESCRIPTION` file, e.g.: `LinkingTo: StealLikeBayes` and `Imports: StealLikeBayes`.
- [ ] Include dependencies in your `R/*-package.R` file, e.g.: `@import: StealLikeBayes`
- [ ] Include our header in your `src/*.cpp` files, e.g.: `#include "StealLikeBayes.h"`.
- [ ] Use our functions in your **C++** code, e.g.: 
```
arma::vec out = StealLikeBayes::rnorm1_precision_sampler(zeros<vec>(10), ones<vec>(10), -0.5);
```

### Use our **R** code in your **R** package

That's simple!

- [ ] Include dependencies in your `DESCRIPTION` file, e.g.: `Imports: StealLikeBayes`.
- [ ] Include dependencies in your `R/*-package.R` file, e.g. `@importFrom StealLikeBayes rnorm1_precision_sampler`.
- [ ] Use our functions in your **R** code, e.g.: 
```
out = StealLikeBayes::rnorm1_precision_sampler(rep(0, 10), rep(1, 10), -0.5)
```

## Installation

#### The first time you install the package

You must have a **cpp** compiler. Follow the instructions from [Section 1.3. by Eddelbuettel & François (2023)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-FAQ.pdf). In short, for **Windows:** install [RTools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/), for **macOS:** install [Xcode Command Line Tools](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-xcode-command-line-tools/), and for **Linux:** install the standard development packages.

#### Once that's done:

You can install the **StealLikeBayes** package by running:
``` r
install_packages("StealLikeBayes")
```

You can install the developer's version of **StealLikeBayes** from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bsvars/StealLikeBayes) by running:
``` r
devtools::install_github("bsvars/StealLikeBayes")
```
